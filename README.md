# AR4

## Why 
A public repo the AR 2&3 community can use to build AR4

Some additional requested features we can decide together to work on. 

If you have a requested feature feel free to create an github issue in this repo. 

Proposed by Kstan Simit 3/12 + 2021 + ~13.8B

- Use non-contact limit switch to avoid robot arm fall and damage the limit switch
- remove too much wiring, use CAN bus (or etc) to reduce wire into minimal (come with encoder)
- more flexible robot training method (like hand hold)
- Better emergency stop (currently emergency stop will stop power supply and collapse arm position, that look danger and will hurt the arm)
- natively support ROS/MOVEIT
- tough design, can support >=2kg (in my opinion if possible change the j5 belt to others mechanism)
- more fancy and user friendly software design, now program the arm really less user friendly
- more up to date computer vision function
- Look/Feel compatible to all Mac/Win/Linux
- More error feed back/sound feed back
- Easier to integrate more sensor/buttons/switches
